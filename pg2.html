<p> There is no built-in “preview” button directly within GitHub itself. However, you can use external services to view your HTML files as rendered web pages. Here are the steps to achieve this:
</p>
<h2>GitHub HTML Preview:</h2>
<p>Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL: GitHub HTML Preview
In the input field, paste the full URL of your index.html file on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/index.html).
Click the “Preview” button to see the rendered version of your HTML file.

</p>
<h2>Raw.githack.com:</h2>
<p>
Visit Raw.githack.com
In the input field, paste the raw URL of your index.html file (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/index.html).
Click the “Run” button to view the rendered HTML page.
Remember that these services provide read-only views, and any dynamic functionality (such as form submissions or JavaScript interactions) won’t work in this context. For full testing, consider setting up a local development environment or deploying your project to a live server. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
